                    &emsp; My name is Christopher Frost, and I am currently an undergraduate 
                    student at <a target=_blank href="https://www.unm.edu" class="unmlink">
                    The University of New Mexico</a>. This portfolio was made as my final for 
                    English 2210, which I took during the spring term in 2023. This course was
                    a useful/applicative class that taught me how to create strong, professional
                    documents. Throughout the course we had four major assignments: writing a
                    communication dossier, some instruction sets, a recommendation report, and
                    a reflective memo - all of which are accessible on this website by using the
                    navigational menu at the top of the page. In creating these documents, I learned
                    how to carefully consider the audience of each written document so that I could pick 
                    a genre that would be most effective. I also learned how to properly format various
                    professional documents, like memorandums and letters, as well as what should/should
                    not be included in them. 
                    
                    <br><br>

                    &emsp; These skills were worthwhile to learn as I will need to exercise them in my career
                    going forward. Today's work environment is becoming increasingly more online and
                    global. As such, being able to tailor written communication to individuals with
                    different backgrounds and culture is vital! Further, since a lot of communication
                    takes place over the internet now, it is beneficial to know how to distribute/maintain
                    correspondence both online and offline.
