description: This is a simple platformer web game I made. There are a total of six short levels, and your goal is to find the other cat to nap with. While the tile sheet was made by <a href="https://muchopixels.itch.io/" target="_blank">someone else</a>, the level design and animal assets were created by me. To view the game, click <a href="/SleepyKittys">here</a>
