description: This is a small scale text adventure game. Again, this was made for a friend. To progress, you add the yellow word/phrase to the end of the URL. The tediousness of adding keywords to the URL is what inspired a better workaround in my ARG (automatic redirection with links). The last bit of this game showcases some more interactive HTML. To play, click <a href="/textAdventure">here</a>.
